Google Shopping scraper is essential to retrieve accurate data on products and prices of your biggest competitors and make data-driven decisions to scale your business.

Does Google have its own e-commerce platform? Yes. Google Shopping is an e-commerce service provided by Google that allows users to search, view and compare products.

In today's data-driven business environment, Google Shopping result data contains huge business value, such as market insights, price analysis, consumer trend prediction, etc., which is of great strategic significance to various enterprises and market researchers.

However, traditional crawling methods may face problems such as high technical barriers, low efficiency, and inaccurate data. Is there a simple and effective way to solve these problems?

In this tutorial, you can crawl Google Shopping results on a large scale in a few minutes without touching crawling technology.

## What Is Google Shopping?
Google Shopping (formerly known as Google Products Search, Google Products, and Froogle) is a platform that enhances the online shopping experience by aggregating product information from various retailers. Google Shopping allows users to browse, compare, and purchase products from different suppliers.

Google Shopping not only provides consumers with the opportunity to choose the best products among thousands of brands, but also brings benefits to retailers. When users click on a product link, they are redirected to the vendor's website to make the purchase; thus, Google Shopping is a solution for businesses to advertise their products online.

For more information on how Google Shopping works, see the [documentation tutorial](https://apidocs.scrapeless.com/api-14111890).

### Competitor analysis
On Google Shopping, you can collect many parameters of products. Data includes product size, material, color, etc. This information can help you better understand the position, strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. Ultimately, you can better position yourself in the market.

### Price monitoring
As mentioned earlier, a Google Shopping scraper provides price comparison services. Customers browse this site to find the best deal. And industry professionals like you can see how competitors price their products. Monitoring dynamic prices will help you develop a successful pricing strategy.

### Consumer feedback collection
Information such as user reviews and ratings on Google Shopping is crucial to product improvement and user experience optimization. Reviews are a true reflection of the actual experience of the product, which can guide sellers to clearly improve the direction of improvement. For example, the problem of short battery life of electronic products can be optimized accordingly; ratings intuitively reflect product quality and affect purchase decisions. High ratings help conversions, and low ratings need to be improved.

## Is Google Shopping easy to crawl?
Scrape Google Shopping can be a non-trivial task. Not only is Google Shopping good at detecting automated requests, but it also requires parsing JavaScript, which is an "expensive" operation that slows down the crawling process.

You can also directly integrate our reference code into your program. Just replace `your_token` with the token you applied for:
```Python
import json
import requests


class Payload:
    def __init__(self, actor, input_data):
        self.actor = actor
        self.input = input_data


def send_request():
    host = "api.scrapeless.com"
    url = f"https://{host}/api/v1/scraper/request"
    token = your_token ## replace with your API Token

    headers = {
        "x-api-token": token
    }

    input_data = {
        "engine": "google_scholar",
        "q": "biology",
    }

    payload = Payload("scraper.google.scholar", input_data)

    json_payload = json.dumps(payload.__dict__)

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json_payload)

    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
        return

    print("body", response.text)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_request()
```

## FAQs:
### Does Google Shopping have an API?
Google used to offer a shopping search API. But Google shut it down on September 16, 2013. This decision scared many retailers at the time because without this tool, they might lose knowledge of the market. Currently there is a shopping content API on Google that enables retailers to control and track their ads and products.

### Is it legal to scrape Google shopping data?
Generally speaking, as long as you strictly follow all regulations on collecting public data and make sure that the information you are scraping is public. In most cases, data scraping is not illegal. But we still strongly recommend that you read the platform's terms of service before launching a scraper to extract data to avoid any unexpected unpleasantness.
